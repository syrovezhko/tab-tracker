You should install all dependencies for `client` and `server` components for starters.
Run the terminal in the `tab-tracker` folder.  
  
First, check out node.js instalation using `node -v` comand. It'll displayed your **_node.js_** version. Otherwise, go to [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) official webpage and download the latest **LTS** version.  
  
Then open `client` folder and install dependencies by `cd client && npm install` comand.  
Make the same for `server` part using `cd .. && cd server && npm install`.
### Congradilations! We are ready to start!
Open the second terminal's window for the convenience.  
Let's use the first terminal for `server` and second for `client`.  
In order to open `client` folder with new terminal use `cd client && npm run dev`.  
But for server just start with `npm start` command.
